# BNW007 - Switched my Read-it-later APP

I was hesitant to switch my Read-it-later APP from Cubox to Readwise Reader.  I have used Cubox for almost a year and collected a lot of articles.  I like its UI and I created scripts for my RSS feeds. Besides, it's about half the price of Readwise Reader. 

But I still paid a year of subscription fee and switched to Readwise Reader this week.

1. There's a 50% off education discount
2. I really like how Readwise Reader handles Youtube videos
3. With the browser extension, I can highlight sentences and write notes directly on the webpage
4. A lot of useful keyboard shortcuts. My fingers don't have to leave the keyboard as I go through my inbox


I just got a new laptop and I'm still setting it up. So this is a very short newsletter. I'll write more for the next edition.
