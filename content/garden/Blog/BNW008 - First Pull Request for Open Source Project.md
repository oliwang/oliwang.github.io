# BNW008 - First Pull Request for Open Source Project

Are you looking for ways to dip your toes into open source contributions? If you've been hesitant to try it out, I completely understand. It can be a little intimidating to jump into a completely new project and start contributing. But I'm here to tell you that it's not as difficult as it may seem!

I've had my Github account for several years, but mostly used it for personal projects. Contributing to open-source projects always seemed complicated to me, but recently I finally decided to give it a try.

It all started with my internship last year. During my internship, I was tasked with generating monitor tests to check if the response returned from an API request was valid. The response could be an array of objects, and I didn't care about the order of the elements as long as elements with certain values were present. Unfortunately, there was no matcher in the Jest library that could do this, so I had to write an extension.

While working on this extension, I realized that this feature could easily be added to the Jest library, and it would make a great first PR to an open-source project for me.

Getting started took me a while. Setting up seemed daunting at first, but once I got into it, it wasn't that bad. The feature wasn't that hard to code, but as a first-time contributor, I made several mistakes. For example, I forgot to change the type definition and add type tests.

The maintainers of the repository were incredibly friendly and helpful, and they helped me solve the problems one by one. I'm hopeful that my commit can be merged into the main branch next week.
