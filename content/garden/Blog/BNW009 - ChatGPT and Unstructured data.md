# BNW009 - ChatGPT and Unstructured data

Last week, my cousin attempted to use ChatGPT to process data. Specifically, she needed to convert a column in a table from 24-hour to 12-hour format and then separate the data into AM and PM rows. Unfortunately, ChatGPT was unable to complete this task with a single instruction, much to her dismay. After breaking the task into two steps, ChatGPT still missed some data in several rows.

To improve the accuracy of the prompt, she could provide more specific instructions to ChatGPT or consider writing a Python script to modify the table. This would give her more control over the data processing and avoid any inconsistencies or missing rows.

Recently, I came across a viral Twitter video demonstrating how Apple shortcuts scripts can call Open AI's API and Notion's API. With this script, you can tell Siri how much money you spent on something in natural language and the shortcut will post this data to a Notion database. It's amazing how GPT can turn unstructured data into structured data, and I believe there are many other potential applications for this technology.

- I thought this book is writen for children, but I was wrong. It's quite dark.
- The narrator of the story, AF Klara, observes the human world and tries to understand it in her own way.
- Klara gives her everything to human, especially to Josie, the girl who bought her and brought her home. But she is still alone. She is not really connected with any human or AF. 
- After reading book reviews, I learned that the author uses the technique of estrangement and defamiliarization. I noticed that Klara calls drones "machine birds" and cellphones "oblongs" but I didn't really find it significant. Maybe because English is not my mother tongue, it's much harder for me to notice the nuance in these words?
