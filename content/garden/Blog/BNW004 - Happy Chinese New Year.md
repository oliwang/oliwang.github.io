# BNW004 - Happy Chinese New Year

I wish you all the best for the year of the Rabbit! (You should google "the year of the rabbit". There's an easter egg.)

I paid for a one-month Midjourney subscription to generate my own WeChat red packet cover. I love Midjourney and it's really addictive. I can't stop myself from trying out different keywords and art styles. A word I just learned is "chinoiserie". The result just looks amazing. It also feels amazing when I see a beautiful image on Social Media and reverse engineer its keywords.

My favorite artist last year was Xu Bing. I went to see his exhibition at the Museum of Art Pudong (MAP) several months ago. It was very inspirational. I love the way he creates a whole set of items to fit the worldview. So when I heard there was an exhibition of his artwork in Nanjing, I had to go and see it.

The exhibition itself was quite small; there were about twenty art pieces in total from 6 different artists. But I think it was worth the money because there were four copies of Xu Bing's "Book from the Ground" that the visitors could touch and flip through. In MAP, the book was in vitrines. I didn't know that it was an interactive pop-up book. My favorite page was the one with Tetris.

- The second and third episodes of [Jin (TV series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_(TV_series)) are about cholera.
- This is a pre-covid book. But so much resonant with this post-covid world.
- The author states in the book that global warming is detrimental to humans, as it reduces the temperature difference between body temperature and environmental temperature. Many viruses cannot survive in the human body's temperature, thus preventing the spread of numerous serious diseases. However, as the environmental temperature rises, viruses gradually become adapted to higher temperatures. The temperature gap could eventually vanish, leading to more viruses becoming a threat to humans.
