excerpt: "The intermediate plateau is a frustrating stage of learning where progress slows and it is difficult to tell if effort is paying off. Three theories for why we get stuck in this stage are discussed: knowledge grows exponentially with the level of expertise, progress comes to rely more on unlearning than new learning, and creative problem-solving overtakes (and is harder than!) imitating others. To move beyond intermediacy, one must invest exponential effort, practice unlearning, and seek expert mentorship."

The intermediate plateau is a frustrating stage of learning where progress slows and it is difficult to tell if effort is paying off. Three theories for why we get stuck in this stage are discussed: knowledge grows exponentially with the level of expertise, progress comes to rely more on unlearning than new learning, and creative problem-solving overtakes (and is harder than!) imitating others. To move beyond intermediacy, one must invest exponential effort, practice unlearning, and seek expert mentorship.
