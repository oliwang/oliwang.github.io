My mom's new year's resolution is to recite one poem a day so I made this script for her. Each day at 6 am, a poem is randomly chosen and saved as a note in Apple Notes.

Data is from [chinese-poetry/chinese-poetry: The most comprehensive database of Chinese poetry 🧶最全中华古诗词数据库, 唐宋两朝近一万四千古诗人, 接近5.5万首唐诗加26万宋诗. 两宋时期1564位词人，21050首词。](https://github.com/chinese-poetry/chinese-poetry) .
