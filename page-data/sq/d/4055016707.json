Three theories for why we get stuck in this stage are discussed: knowledge grows exponentially with the level of expertise, progress comes to rely more on unlearning than new learning, and creative problem-solving overtakes (and is harder than!) imitating others. To move beyond intermediacy, one must invest exponential effort, practice unlearning, and seek expert mentorship.","tags":["Sharing","RSS","learning"]}}},{"node":{"id":"ecd02b78-034a-57a2-ae2e-88760c668896","excerpt":"Reading Better Retaining and Applying What You Read from Read Something Greate Newsletter in English reading #book IMAGE Reading techniques.
